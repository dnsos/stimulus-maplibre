# Stimulus MapLibre controller

A Stimulus controller that registers a MapLibre map with some configurations.

## Roadmap

- [x] get basic repo setup done (according to stimulus-components examples)
- [x] implement first, simplest version of attaching a map with this
- [x] add more features
- [x] add test setup and first test stub
- [ ] add marker center option

## Developing

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> You will then be able to work on the controller making use of its use in `index.html`.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- add the Maplibre CSS in your own HTML (?)
- peer dependencies?
